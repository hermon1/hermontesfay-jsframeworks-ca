# JavaScript Frameworks CA


## Goal

To apply knowledge of React to build an eCom store.

## Description

The homepage has a list of products with a search bar that filters. Clicking on the product takes the user to the to individual page where there are details but also reviews of the product. Its easy to add the product to the cart by clicking the "add to cart button". When you checkout you will be notified that the purchase is complete.
The contact page with form validation is a simple way to get in touch.

I wanted the ecom store to be appealing to the customer with a simple design. Its easy to navigate and simple for the customer to make a transaction. My focus was to create positive and seamless shopping experience for the customers.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- React
- Yup and react-hook-form 
- styled-components

## Hosting Services

-  Netlify

## Installation and Setup

First clone down the project from github.  

Then open the project and run `npm install` in the terminal.  

Next you can run: 

`npm start` 

This will open a webbrowser and run the application in developer mode locally on your computer. Normally the application starts on `port 3000` if it is not already in use - press `Y` to open on another port. This page will reload when you save any changes. You can also see any errors in the terminal and console.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
